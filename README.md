### Project Description
A fun, reflex-testing browser game where your mouse becomes the player! Navigate through randomly generated mazes, avoid the walls, and race to the red square ‚Äî but blink (or crash) three times, and it‚Äôs game over. Simple, addictive, and just frustrating enough to keep you coming back!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
‚ÄúToo many people are reaching their destination without hitting invisible walls with their mouse.‚Äù

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
‚ÄúWe built a game where your mouse is trapped in a maze, and the walls punish your overconfidence. Hit one? Restart. Hit three? Rebuild the universe (well, the maze).‚Äù

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
# Web Browser
‚Äì To run and test the game (Chrome)

# Code Editor
‚Äì To write and edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files (Visual Studio Code).

 Developer Tools (Built-in Browser Dev Tools)
‚Äì For debugging and inspecting the canvas, mouse events, and layout.

 HTML/CSS/JavaScript
‚Äì Core languages used to build the entire game interface, visuals, and logic.


### Implementation
This project is built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It runs directly in the browser and does not require any external libraries or frameworks.

# Installation
No installation is required if you're using a browser and a code editor.

# Run
You can run the game in two simple ways:

Option 1 ‚Äì From File System

 Just double-click the HTML file- It will open in your default browser
 
Option 2 ‚Äì Using Live Server in VS Code

 Right-click the HTML file ‚Üí "Open with Live Server"

Figure 1: Welcome Screen of the Mouse Maze Game
This is the front page of the game where the player is introduced to the objective. It features a clean UI with a game title, brief instructions, and a prominent "Start Game" button. Once clicked, it transitions into the actual maze gameplay.

Figure 2: Gameplay Interface of the Mouse Maze Game
This is the main game screen where the player navigates from the blue square (start) to the red square (goal) without touching any black walls. If the pointer touches a wall, a restart prompt is triggered. The sleek dark background and clear layout ensure focus on the maze. The top-right EXIT button allows players to return to the home screen.

Figure 3: Wall Collision and Restart Popup
If the player‚Äôs mouse touches a wall, a friendly (yet firm) popup message appears saying: ‚ÄúYou hit a wall! Click restart to try again.‚Äù
The game pauses until the player clicks the Restart button, which sends the pointer back to the start. This enforces discipline in navigation and adds a fun penalty mechanic to the gameplay.

This video demonstrates the interactive gameplay of our Mouse Maze Game, a fun and slightly annoying challenge where your mouse becomes your worst enemy. The objective is simple: reach the red exit square without touching any walls.

   The video walks through:
     The welcome screen and entry to the game
     Real-time mouse movement through a randomly generated maze
     What happens when the player hits a wall ‚Äî including a popup warning and a forced restart
     The reset mechanics that ensure the pointer starts back at the green square
     A successful path to the goal

Perfect for testing your patience and precision. No one asked for this‚Ä¶ but we built it anyway.
